# Smart Reconciliation & Audit System

## Overview
A MERN stack app for transaction reconciliation with audit trails.

## Architecture
- Frontend: React with Redux.
- Backend: Express with async workers.
- DB: MongoDB with indexed collections.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies: `npm install` in both folders.
2. Start MongoDB.
3. Run backend: `npm start` in /backend.
4. Run frontend: `npm start` in /frontend.

## Assumptions
- Files up to 50k records.
- Rules configurable via JSON.

## Trade-Offs
- No ML for matching; simple rules.
- Async via workers; scalable but not distributed.

## Limitations
- No multi-file uploads; single file per job.
- Excel parsing assumes standard format.
